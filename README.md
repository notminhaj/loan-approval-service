# loan-approval-service
deploying my first ML model!!

This is a Kaggle competition where I was tasked with creating a loan approval model using the data that was given to me. I used a random forest regressor to build my model. Decided not to go crazy with all the ML strategies to increase my accuracy since my main focus was to have a deployed which I could make api calls to.

Unfortunately the "loan approval model.pkl" was too large to upload to github so you have to make it using the training script by training the model on train_data (it does it for you).

Make sure to add the scoring uri the training script provides you with into app.py.

Hope it runs perfectly!
